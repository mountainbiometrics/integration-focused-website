### Executive Summary

The success of PE-backed healthcare rollups depends on how fast a platform can unify operations after each acquisition. Most cannot do it fast enough. Each acquired practice brings its own EHR, billing system, and years of accumulated data conventions. The integration required to produce consolidated reporting routinely takes twelve to thirty-six months, and the conventional approach gets more expensive with every new acquisition, not less.

The cost of this visibility gap is concrete. For a mid-to-large platform, we estimate the combined monthly cost at **$200,000 to $500,000** in revenue leakage, duplicative labor, and legacy system carrying costs. A five-year hold that loses twelve to eighteen months to integration is really a three-and-a-half to four-year hold.

We introduce a platform that compresses integration timelines from months to weeks with a team of 3 to 5 instead of 15 to 25, and keeps maintenance flat as the portfolio grows. For a ten-clinic portfolio, that acceleration unlocks over **$2 million in year-one EBITDA**, translating to approximately **$24 million in enterprise value** at a 12x exit multiple.

### The Cost of Delayed Integration (Executive Edition)

A PE-backed dermatology platform closes on its fifth acquisition in eighteen months. Each practice arrived with its own EHR, billing system, and data conventions. The integration consultants are four months into the third site and have not started the fourth. The CFO cannot produce a consolidated denial report for the board. Meanwhile, the sixth deal is already in letter of intent.

This is the default experience of healthcare consolidation in the United States today. And the gap between the pace of acquisition and the pace of data integration is the single greatest underappreciated risk in PE-backed healthcare rollups.

#### The Consolidation Wave

Add-on acquisitions now account for approximately seventy-three percent of all PE buyout deals. The target specialties, dermatology, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, dental, orthopedics, and behavioral health, share the profile that makes rollups attractive: fragmented markets, favorable payer mixes, and high-margin procedural revenue. They also share the profile that makes data integration hardest, because no two practices encode their operations the same way.

The economic logic depends entirely on integration speed. Top-performing PE firms target operational unification within six months of close, because every month of delayed integration is a month of unrealized synergies: duplicate billing teams, fragmented reporting, and missed opportunities to optimize across the portfolio.

#### What the Visibility Gap Costs

Every month of incomplete integration extends a visibility gap during which consolidated analytics and revenue cycle improvements simply do not exist. Five clinics, five different ways of recording why a claim was denied. One uses industry-standard codes. Another uses free text. A third tracks only paid-or-not. Until someone translates all five into a common language, the CFO cannot tell the board what the top denial reasons are across the platform.

For a mid-to-large platform, the combined monthly cost of this visibility gap runs **$200,000 to $500,000**, spanning three categories: revenue leakage from unresolved denials, duplicative labor across parallel workflows, and the carrying cost of legacy systems that cannot yet be decommissioned. Over forty percent of healthcare organizations report losing ten percent or more of annual revenue to leakage, and up to sixty-five percent of denied claims are never resubmitted.

How many months after your last close before the CFO could produce a consolidated denial report for the board? If the answer is "we are still working on it," you are operating the portfolio on faith rather than data.

#### Why It Gets Worse with Every Acquisition

The eighth acquisition should be easier than the first, not harder. But with conventional integration, every new system you add makes every existing integration more expensive to maintain. The reason is structural: changes in one system's data formats, vendor updates, coding standards, or local conventions can break integrations with every other system already connected.

At fifty active integrations, the team spends all its capacity maintaining what already exists. New acquisitions stall. The rollup thesis breaks.

> **FIGURE: Maintenance Burden Growth (Executive Edition)**
> A chart showing two curves indexed to a baseline. Conventional integration maintenance compounds steeply as portfolio size grows (~6x at 500 integrations). Data Foundry / shared-layer approach stays under 2x. Caption: "As portfolio size grows, conventional integration maintenance compounds. Each new system increases the burden on every existing integration. A shared-layer approach keeps maintenance growth nearly flat. Shaded regions indicate ranges based on portfolio complexity."

A typical enterprise healthcare data integration project runs approximately $2 million, with a team of fifteen to twenty-five people working eight to ten weeks per batch. The conventional approach resets to near-zero with each acquisition. Nothing compounds. Nothing scales.

#### The Hold Period Problem

A five-year hold that loses twelve to eighteen months to integration is really a three-and-a-half to four-year hold. That is twenty to thirty percent of the period your investors are paying for, spent waiting for systems to talk to each other instead of producing returns. Manual data processes alone extend deal timelines by an estimated thirty percent.

The project risk is equally real. Large-scale IT projects run an average of forty-five percent over budget while delivering fifty-six percent less value than predicted. One in six becomes a black swan with cost overruns exceeding two hundred percent. A CEO or CFO who has lived through a failed ERP implementation understands this risk. The question is not whether integration is necessary. It is whether you can afford to do it the conventional way.

### Compressing Integration from Months to Weeks (Executive Edition)

#### What It Does

MTN's Data Foundry platform takes a fundamentally different approach to healthcare data integration. Rather than building connections between every system and every other system, the platform maps each source to a single shared layer. The result: adding the fiftieth source does not require touching sources one through forty-nine.

The system automatically proposes data mappings for human review and approval. An analyst, not a senior engineer, can review and approve a typical integration in five to fifteen minutes. When source systems change, the platform detects the deviation automatically and queues it for review. This is what keeps the maintenance burden flat regardless of portfolio size.

In benchmark testing across the structural diversity found in healthcare rollups, the system achieves over ninety-nine percent mapping accuracy. Anything the system is not confident about is flagged for human review. Nothing goes live without explicit sign-off.

#### The Comparison

Your current approach requires fifteen to twenty-five people over eight to ten weeks per integration batch. Data Foundry does it with three to five people in two to three weeks.

At fifty active integrations, the conventional approach requires two to three dedicated engineers just to keep existing integrations running. Data Foundry requires one part-time reviewer.

A typical enterprise integration project runs $2 million. The platform compresses both cost and timeline by an order of magnitude, not by cutting corners, but by eliminating the structural redundancy that makes conventional integration expensive in the first place.

#### EBITDA Impact

Consider a newly acquired practice generating $10 million in annual revenue at a fifteen percent EBITDA margin. The PE thesis projects that centralized billing, improved denial management, and operational economies will raise that margin to twenty percent, producing an additional $500,000 in annual EBITDA. Traditional integration delays those improvements by six months or more. By compressing integration to one to two months, roughly four to five additional months of enhanced margin are realized in year one: approximately **$208,000 in additional EBITDA per clinic**.

Across a portfolio of ten acquisitions, the acceleration effect alone exceeds **$2 million in year-one value**. At a representative exit multiple of 12x EBITDA, that translates to approximately **$24 million in enterprise value**. A return that dwarfs the cost of the integration platform itself.

#### Exit Readiness

At exit, buyers pay more for genuinely integrated platforms than for a collection of logos under a holding company. Practitioner commentary frames this directly: "real integration in buy-and-builds" avoids the discount that comes with incomplete unification, while genuinely integrated platforms earn multiple expansion. Even a 0.5x to 1.0x multiple differential on exit EBITDA can be worth tens of millions.

Firms that invest in modern data architecture outperform peers by fifteen to twenty percent in portfolio company value creation.

Integration quality is not a back-office concern. It is exit defense.

### Next Steps (Executive Edition)

#### The Visibility Imperative

The pattern is clear. Private equity investment in healthcare continues to accelerate, with approximately seventy-three percent of PE buyout deals structured as add-on acquisitions. Each acquisition adds new systems, new data structures, and new integration burden. The question facing every platform operator is not whether to integrate, but whether to keep doing it the way that gets more expensive with every acquisition.

Every month of visibility gap carries a concrete cost: an estimated $200,000 to $500,000 per month for a mid-to-large platform. The conventional approach has a structural limitation that no amount of staffing can overcome: its costs grow faster than your portfolio.

#### Integration Complexity Assessment

We offer an integration complexity assessment: a two-week analysis that maps your current data landscape, identifies the specific visibility gaps across your portfolio, and estimates the cost of delayed integration at your current acquisition pace.

Whether you are evaluating a platform acquisition, midway through a multi-site integration, or planning for the next phase of growth, the core question is the same: how many active data sources will you have in eighteen months, and does your current integration approach scale to that number?

**Title:** CLOSE THE VISIBILITY GAP
**Subtitle:** Data Integration Is the Hidden Risk in Healthcare Rollups
**Edition:** TECHNICAL EDITION
**Document Number:** MTN-WP-001-v0

### Executive Summary (Technical Edition)

The success of health care rollups depends on rapid operational unification across every new acquisition. However, most platforms cannot see across their own portfolios. Each acquired practice brings its own EHR, billing system, and data conventions, and the integration required to produce consolidated reporting routinely takes twelve to thirty-six months. The underlying problem is structural: both traditional engineering and new AI-generated scripting produce maintenance costs that grow quadratically with portfolio size. Every new acquisition makes every existing integration harder to maintain. At scale, the integration team spends its entire capacity on upkeep, and the rollup stalls.

The cost of this visibility gap is concrete. Based on industry benchmarks for denial-related revenue loss, duplicative staffing, and deferred operational improvements, we estimate that mid-to-large platforms lose $200,000 to $500,000 per month while integration remains incomplete. More than 40% of healthcare organizations report losing 10% or more of annual revenue to leakage, up to 65% of denied claims are never resubmitted, and firms without modern data architecture capabilities forgo a 15 to 20 percent advantage in portfolio company value creation.

We introduce a technology that compresses typical integration timelines from months to weeks, with a team of 3-5 instead of 15-25, and keeps maintenance roughly constant regardless the number of active sources. In benchmark testing across 60 structural format variants spanning the data types found in healthcare rollups, the system achieves 99.0% mapping accuracy at $3.30 per field mapping. By accelerating integration by four to five months per acquisition, a ten-clinic portfolio can unlock over $2 million in year-one EBITDA improvement, translating to approximately $24 million in enterprise value at a 12x exit multiple.

### The Visibility Gap (Technical Edition)

A PE-backed dermatology platform closes on its fifth acquisition in eighteen months. Each practice arrived with its own EHR, its own billing system, and its own way of classifying everything from denial reasons to payer identifiers. The integration consultants are four months into a data-mapping project at the third site and have not yet started on the fourth. The CFO cannot produce a consolidated denial report for the board. Meanwhile, the sixth deal is already in letter of intent.

#### The Consolidation Wave

The healthcare rollup thesis is now the dominant PE playbook in the sector. Add-on acquisitions now account for approximately seventy-three percent of all PE buyout deals, each bringing its own EHR, billing system, and years of accumulated local data conventions onto the platform. The target specialties, dermatology, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, dental, orthopedics, and behavioral health, share the profile that makes rollups attractive: fragmented markets, favorable payer mixes, and high-margin procedural revenue.

The operating partner who assembled a twenty-clinic platform is not managing twenty clinics. They are managing the gap between twenty clinics and one unified operation.

#### What the Data Landscape Actually Looks Like

The challenge is concrete and immediate.

When a new clinic is brought onto a platform, the data problems begin at the field level. Something as fundamental as date of birth may be stored as `Patient_DOB` in one system and `BirthDate` in another, in different formats, with different data types. Multiply this by provider identifiers, insurance plan codes, procedure codes, diagnostic codes and dozens of other fields, the scope of the mapping problem becomes clear.

The problem intensifies with clinical and billing codes. One acquired practice may still use legacy ICD-9 codes for certain diagnoses. Another has developed proprietary internal codes for procedures that have no standard equivalent. Payer identifiers differ across every system: United Healthcare might be `UHC001` in one billing platform and `UnitedHealth-99` in another.

Denial management illustrates the problem at its sharpest. Consider five clinics, each handling denials differently:

- **Clinic A** attaches standardized ANSI CARC codes (e.g., CARC 45, CARC 27) to each denial.
- **Clinic B** stores free-text reasons typed by billers ("Insurance expired," "Need medical notes").
- **Clinic C** uses internal numeric codes on a proprietary scale of 1 to 10.
- **Clinic D** records denial information in a general notes field mixed with other data.
- **Clinic E** tracks only whether a claim was paid or not, with no denial reason captured at all.

This is not a technology problem. It is a **visibility** problem. The data needed to make decisions exists, but it cannot be seen in a unified way.

Without integrated systems, staff become the integration layer. Finance and operations teams at portfolio companies spend roughly half their time gathering and reconciling data rather than analyzing it. This time produces no analytical value.

The financial cost scales superlinearly with portfolio size:
- Small rollup (3-5 practices): $100,000 to $300,000 over six to nine months
- Mid-size platform (10-20 practices): $500,000 to $1.5 million over twelve to eighteen months
- Large platforms (30+ sites): routinely exceed $2 million over two to three years

Every month of incomplete integration extends the visibility gap. For a mid-to-large platform, the combined monthly cost runs $200,000 to $500,000, spanning three categories: revenue leakage from unresolved denials, duplicative labor across parallel workflows, and the carrying cost of legacy systems. Peer-reviewed research cites Optum data showing the average facility loses 2 to 3 percent of yearly revenue to preventable leakage. For a fifteen-site platform generating $75 million in aggregate revenue, even conservative assumptions produce a combined gap of $256,000 to $406,000 per month.

#### Why Current Approaches Fail at Scale

Healthcare data is uniquely resistant to standardized integration. Every EHR implementation is customized. Coding schemes vary not just between vendors but between installations of the same vendor. Two hospitals running identical Epic instances can have radically different data architectures underneath.

**Traditional human engineering** has been the default approach for decades. The per-integration cost runs $2,800 to $5,800, and a team of fifteen to twenty-five can handle a batch of fifty sources in eight to ten weeks.

The problem compounds with maintenance. At fifty active integrations, a platform can expect two to five variation events per week. By two hundred integrations, the maintenance load alone demands five to ten dedicated engineers, and the cost compounds quadratically.

**AI-generated integration scripts** appear to solve the cost problem. Initial per-integration cost drops to $135 to $540. But each integration produces a bespoke script with no shared architecture. The maintenance cost at scale actually exceeds traditional engineering.

The core issue is the **shape of the maintenance curve**. Both traditional and AI-scripted approaches produce maintenance costs that grow quadratically with the number of active integrations.

> **FIGURE: Annual Maintenance Hours (Technical Edition)**
> A two-panel chart. Top panel shows annual maintenance hours for Traditional Engineering (dark gray, quadratic growth to ~53,000 hrs at 500 integrations) and LLM-Generated Scripts (warm orange, starts cheaper but crosses above Traditional at ~200 integrations, reaching ~69,000 hrs at 500). A dotted vertical line marks "LLM exceeds traditional" crossover point. Bottom panel shows Data Foundry on its own scale (0-100 hrs/yr), staying nearly flat at 23-42 hours/year. X-axis: Number of Active Integrations. Caption: "Annual maintenance hours by number of active integrations. Traditional and LLM hours are derived from labor costs at a $65/hr fully-loaded rate; Data Foundry hours are derived from documented variation-event rates. LLM-generated scripts start cheaper but exceed traditional engineering beyond ~200 integrations. Shaded regions indicate ranges."

The track record reinforces the structural concern. Large-scale IT projects run an average of 45% over budget while delivering 56% less value than predicted. In healthcare, industry estimates place the failure or significant shortfall rate for enterprise healthcare IT projects at seventy to eighty percent. Annual upkeep typically runs fifteen to twenty percent of the initial integration investment, and more than half of total ownership cost accrues after go-live.

> **The question for any platform operator is straightforward: at your current rate of acquisition, when does the maintenance curve cross the line where integration overhead exceeds the operational capacity of your team?** For most growing rollups, the answer is sooner than expected.

### An Architectural Approach (Technical Edition)

#### What a Solution Must Do

1. Adapt to each source system's unique data model without requiring months of manual field-by-field mapping. Healthcare data is too heterogeneous for predefined schemas or static mapping templates.
2. Learn the relationships between disparate data structures. Mapping logic needs to be transparent, auditable, and correctable by domain experts who are not software engineers.
3. Deliver usable integrated data in weeks, not quarters.
4. Maintenance cost must remain roughly constant as the number of active integrations grows. This is the critical requirement.
5. Make accuracy trade-offs explicit. In healthcare, silent data errors carry clinical and financial consequences.

#### Introducing Data Foundry

The MTN Data Foundry is built on a concept-based architecture. Rather than building pairwise mappings between every source system and every target system, Data Foundry maps every source to a shared concept layer. Each concept represents a standardized data element: "Patient.DateOfBirth," "Claim.DenialReasonCode," "Provider.NPI," and so on. Adding a new integration does not require touching any existing integration. The concept layer acts as a universal translator.

> **FIGURE: Concept-Based Architecture Diagram (Full-Width)**
> A two-panel comparison diagram. Left panel ("Pairwise Mapping"): Multiple healthcare source systems (EHRs, billing systems, lab systems, etc.) with crossing arrows to multiple target systems, creating n x m connections. Right panel ("Concept-Based Architecture"): The same sources feed into a central red "Concept Layer" box, which outputs to grouped targets, with only n + m mappings. Caption: "Pairwise mapping (left) produces n x m connections that grow combinatorially. Concept-based architecture (right) reduces this to n + m mappings through a shared semantic layer."

The platform operates through five integrated capabilities:

**Schema Visualization.** When a new data source is loaded, Data Foundry presents its structure visually, allowing analysts to see field names, data types, and sample values alongside the existing concept vocabulary. For denial management across five EHRs, the analyst can immediately see where each system stores denial codes, how they are formatted, and where the gaps are.

**Self-Organizing Concept Maps.** Using the schema metadata and sample data, the system automatically proposes mappings between source fields and target concepts. It identifies obvious matches (such as "DOB" to "Patient.DateOfBirth"), detects format differences (such as "M/F" versus "Male/Female"), and flags ambiguous cases for human review.

**Approval Dashboard.** Every AI-proposed mapping is presented for human review before activation. The dashboard shows confidence scores, sample data values, and suggested transformations. An analyst (not a senior engineer) can review and approve a typical integration in five to fifteen minutes. Nothing goes live without explicit human sign-off.

**Rehydration.** Once mappings are approved, the system materializes the unified dataset. This is the step where five clinics' denial data, each stored in its own format, becomes a single consolidated denial table with standardized fields and codes.

**Self-Healing Maintenance.** When a source system changes (a vendor update, a new field, an unfamiliar code), the platform detects the deviation automatically and queues it for review. At two hundred active sources generating two to five variation events per week, the total review burden is less than one hour per week.

#### How Benchmarked Data Maps to Healthcare

| Benchmarked Source Type | Healthcare Rollup Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Wearable devices | Remote patient monitoring feeds (CGMs, pulse oximeters, connected BP cuffs) |
| Industrial monitors | Clinical device streams (bedside vitals, infusion pumps, spirometry, imaging equipment) |
| IoT gateways | Clinic network hubs and middleware aggregating from multiple devices or rooms |
| Standardized interchange formats | HL7 v2, FHIR R4 bundles, C-CDA documents, X12 EDI (837/835/270/271) |
| Multi-domain platforms | EHR/PM suites (Epic, Athenahealth, NextGen, eClinicalWorks, ModMed, Nextech) |

| Benchmarked Structural Variant | Healthcare Data That Looks Like This |
| --- | --- |
| Flat (CSV/delimited) | Payer fee schedules, eligibility rosters, credentialing spreadsheets, A/R aging exports |
| Nested (hierarchical/JSON) | FHIR resource bundles, C-CDA summaries, multi-level charge/payment hierarchies |
| Entity-attribute-value | Lab results keyed by LOINC, vitals stored as observation rows, custom flowsheet data |
| Columnar batch | Nightly 835 remittance files, batch 837 claims, clearinghouse rejection reports |
| Pipe-delimited | HL7 v2 message segments (PID, OBX, DG1), legacy lab interfaces, pharmacy feeds |
| Wide/sparse-column | Multi-specialty encounter forms, survey instruments, research datasets |

Every acquisition adds three to five of these structural variants simultaneously.

#### Performance Results

| Metric | Result |
| --- | --- |
| **Mapping Accuracy** | 99.0% |
| **Format Consistency** | 100.0% |
| **Record Capture Rate** | 96.2% |
| **Average Mapping Time** | 442 seconds |
| **Average Cost per Mapping** | $3.30 |
| **Total Field Mappings Evaluated** | 480 |

#### The Economics

> **FIGURE: Initial Project Cost Comparison (Technical Edition)**
> A grouped bar chart comparing initial project cost across three portfolio scales (50, 200, 500+ sources) and three approaches (Traditional Engineering in dark gray, LLM-Generated Scripts in warm orange, MTN Data Foundry in brand red). Traditional costs range from $1.5-2.5M (50 sources) to $8-20M (500+ sources). LLM ranges from $500K-900K to $3-7M. Data Foundry achieves ~85-95% reduction. Error bars show min-max ranges. Caption: "Initial project cost by portfolio scale and integration approach. Data Foundry costs remain sub-linear due to concept reuse across sources."

**Where the Cost Savings Come From:**

A typical $2 million enterprise healthcare data integration project breaks down:

- Project management and coordination: 10-15% ($200-300K)
- Data discovery and source analysis: 10-15% ($200-300K)
- Architecture and infrastructure: 15-20% ($300-400K)
- **Mapping and transformation development: 25-35% ($500-700K)**
- Testing and QA: 15-20% ($300-400K)
- Deployment, monitoring, and training: 10-15% ($200-300K)

Data Foundry's primary displacement target is the mapping and transformation layer, where it achieves a 90 to 95 percent cost reduction. The effects cascade: testing effort drops 60 to 75 percent, data discovery drops 30 to 50 percent, and project management overhead drops 20 to 30 percent.

#### EBITDA Impact

Consider a newly acquired practice generating $10 million in annual revenue at a 15% EBITDA margin. The PE thesis projects raising that margin to 20%, producing an additional $500,000 in annual EBITDA. By compressing integration to one to two months, roughly four to five additional months of enhanced margin are realized in year one: approximately $208,000 in additional EBITDA per clinic.

Across a portfolio of ten acquisitions, the acceleration effect alone can exceed $2 million in year-one value. At a representative exit multiple of 12x EBITDA, that $2 million translates to $24 million in enterprise value.

Each month of visibility gap costs a mid-to-large platform an estimated $200,000 to $500,000 in combined revenue leakage, duplicative labor, and legacy system carrying costs.

### Conclusion (Technical Edition)

#### The Visibility Imperative

The pattern is clear. Private equity investment in healthcare continues to accelerate, with approximately seventy-three percent of PE buyout deals structured as add-on acquisitions. Each acquisition adds new systems, new data structures, and new integration burden.

The core risk is not technical complexity. It is visibility. When a platform cannot produce consolidated reporting across its portfolio, when denial patterns remain hidden in five different coding systems, when the CFO's board presentation depends on spreadsheets assembled by hand, the rollup thesis is operating on faith rather than data.

Current integration approaches share a common structural limitation: their maintenance costs grow quadratically with portfolio size. A concept-based architecture offers a fundamentally different cost curve. By mapping every source to a shared concept layer, the marginal cost of adding new sources remains roughly constant. Self-healing maintenance keeps the ongoing burden flat.

#### Next Steps

We offer an integration complexity assessment: a two-week analysis that maps your current data landscape, identifies the specific visibility gaps across your portfolio, and estimates the cost of delayed integration at your current acquisition pace.
